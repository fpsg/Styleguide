        <h1>Guidelines</h1>
        <p>We strive to follow four guiding principles, they are: Clarity, Accessibility, Efficiency and Consistency.</p><br><br>
        <h4>Clarity</h4>
        <p>Clarity is number one, if a user doesn't know what a page does, how to proceed in a flow or what's wrong when we give an error state it is our problem to solve. Given how much cognitive load from the rest of the world (TV, internet, billboards, family, friends etc) our customers have, our first priority is to be as clear as possible.</p><br>
        <h4>Accessibility</h4>
        <p>Our products reach many different people in different locations and situations. We need to think about everyone, from people with 100+ MB connections to dial-up modems, techies to non-techies, perfectly healthy people with the newest iPhone to people with and disabilities and old phones, and design something that makes an effort to work for everyone.</p><br>
        <h4>Efficiency</h4>
        <p>With limited time and abundant choice for the customer, we have to strive to make the interface as efficient as possible. Too many steps in a process can lead to someone leaving our app, so we have to do what we can to make the interface work as efficiently as possibly.</p><br>
        <h4>Consistency</h4>
        <p>We want to offer a consistent foodpanda experience across all platforms, not necessarily have everything look the same, but at least have the experience be similar. Consistency also refers to within the platforms themselves; to use the same colors, behavior and logif for the same elements.</p><br>
        <hr>
        <h4>Special Snowflakes</h4>
        <p>As much as we want everything to be uniform and conform strictly to the system we are creating, there will always be elements that will deviate from the norm. These are referred to as "Special snowflakes". Because we know it will happen, we should be prepared for this scenario.</p><p> In cases we encounter where there's a need for a special snowflake, they must be documented and a reason to why they're special snowflakes must be given in the documentation. Because things change over time and if we know why we did something, we also know when we can melt the snowflake and unify CSS-styles later down the line.</p><hr><br>
